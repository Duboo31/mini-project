                            <p>In Firefox 95, we're shipping a novel sandboxing technology called RLBox — developed in collaboration with researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas — that makes it easy and efficient to isolate subcomponents to make the browser more secure. This technology opens up new opportunities beyond what's been possible with traditional process-based sandboxing, and we look forward to expanding its usage and (hopefully) seeing it adopted in other browsers and software projects.The post WebAssembly and Back Again: Fine-Grained Sandboxing in Firefox 95 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</p>
